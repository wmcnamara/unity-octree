Simple octree Unity implementation. 

Allows for simple and fast octree generation and collision testing.

*If you see checkerboarding its because of gifs annoying compression ):*

Uses AABB's as the collision type, but can be extended to other things.

# Please Note
This **IS NOT** a standalone and generic Unity octree library. Intended to be used as a reference or resource to implement Octrees yourself.
